# Teaching Regression with Simulations
Simulation is an effective tool for teaching regression methods and computer coding skills useful in empirical social science research. 

The goal of this repository is to provide Stata simulation code useful for understanding commonly used regression models in social science research, including ordinary least squares, fixed effects, random effects, difference-in-differences, and regression discontinuity.
